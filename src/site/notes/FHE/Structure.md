## Opening Prayer
This section can be done before or after the introduction. Ask for volunteers or offer to give a prayer for the evening. 

## Introduction
The purpose of the introduction is to... 
The introduction is usually always an icebreaker activity. The most common one being a simple:

The purpose is just to get people talking. 
More interactive variations tend to be better as well.
