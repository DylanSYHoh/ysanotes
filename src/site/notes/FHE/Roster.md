## Preface
Modburyâ€™s Family Home Evenings are organised weekly through collaboration between the Young Single Adults (YSA) and the full-time missionaries. 
This shared organisation allows for a greater variety of creative ideas and activities, as each group brings unique perspectives and strengths. It also provides opportunities for everyone to take turns in planning and leading, helping develop confidence and leadership skills. 
Most importantly, this approach ensures that each evening is well suited to the diverse mix of attendees, being both YSA members and missionary friends.
